# Sober✨

A Chrome extension that blocks access to AI models so you can focus on learning and thinking for yourself.

## Description

Sober is designed for students and programmers who rely heavily on AI and want to take control of their learning. I made this for myself so I could control how I use AI when programming or studying. Sometimes getting information the harder way helps with learning. 

## Features

- Blocks access to popular AI assistant websites
- Shows a motivational (and slightly humorous) message when you attempt to access an AI site
- Allows you to override the block with a confirmation phrase if you really need to use the AI
- Displays which AI site you were trying to access

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files
5. The Sober✨ extension is now installed and active!

## How It Works

When you try to access a blocked AI website, Sober will:
1. Intercept the request
2. Redirect you to a block page
3. Show you which AI site you were trying to access
4. Provide an option to override the block if necessary

### Override Feature

If you absolutely need to use an AI tool, you can override the block by:
1. Clicking the "Override Block" button
2. Typing the phrase "I am about to let AI think for me"
3. Clicking the "Submit" button

## Blocked AI Sites

Sober currently blocks the following AI websites:
- OpenAI ChatGPT (chat.openai.com)

- DeepSeek AI (deepseek.ai)
- Google Bard (bard.google.com)

- Anthropic (anthropic.com)

Thank you and stay Sober! ✨
